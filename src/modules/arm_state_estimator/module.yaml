        ARM_STATE_CH:
            description:
                short: ADC channel to read the arm state from
                long: |
                    The voltage read from this channel with be used to
                    calculate the angle of the arm.

            type: int32
            reboot_required: true
            default: -1

        ARM_STATE_OFFSET:
            description:
                short: Arm sensor voltage offset
                long: |
                    The voltage offset to apply to the measured arm sensor
                    voltage before multiplying by the scale factor.

            type: float
            reboot_required: true
            default: 1.65

        ARM_STATE_SCALE:
            description:
                short: Arm sensor scale factor
                long: |
                    This value will be multiplied with the offset arm sensor
                    voltage to determine the measured arm angle.

            type: float
            reboot_required: true
            default: 1.745
